# Real-Time Lane Detection Application

The Real-Time Lane Detection Application is a Python-based project that utilizes OpenCV and Matplotlib to perform edge detection on live video streams in real time. The project incorporates edge detection algorithms like Canny edge detection, Hough Transform, and other image processing techniques to enhance and visualize edges in video frames.

## Features

- Perform real-time lane detection on live video streams.
- Apply Canny edge detection and Hough Transform to enhance and identify edges.
- Visualize the processed video stream with edges highlighted.
- Utilize OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- Display the processed video using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Prerequisites

- Python: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rgarg2002/Road-Lane-Detection.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Road\ Lane\ Detection


3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. **Run the Application:** Execute the Python script to start the real-time edge detection application.

2. **Exit the Application:** Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.

## Output

The application will open a window displaying the live video stream with edge detection applied. You'll see the edges highlighted in the video as detected by the Canny edge detection and the Hough Transform algorithms.
